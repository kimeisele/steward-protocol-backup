# 🚨 PHASE 2 AUDIT REPORT: Semantic Collision Analysis

**Date:** 2025-11-27
**Auditor:** Senior Architect
**Scope:** Phase 2 vibe-agency integration conflicts
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 3

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Phase 2 introduced **semantic collisions** - multiple components with identical names but different purposes. This violates the principle of "rock solid and water tight" architecture.

**Critical Finding:** We now have **3 different "PlaybookEngine" classes** doing completely different things.

**Recommendation:** HALT Phase 3. Resolve conflicts first via UNIFICATION strategy.

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL CONFLICTS

### 1. PlaybookEngine (Triple Collision)

**Location A: `steward/system_agents/envoy/playbook_engine.py`**
- **Size:** 627 lines
- **Purpose:** GAD-5000 Deterministic Execution Engine
- **What it does:**
  - Loads playbooks from `knowledge/playbooks/*.yaml`
  - Executes phases sequentially (PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED)
  - State machine with ActionType (CALL_AGENT, CHECK_STATE, etc.)
  - Handles LLM Dynamic Routing, Evolutionary Loop (EAD)
  - Fractal/nested playbooks support
- **Used by:** ENVOY agent, tests, universal_provider
- **Origin:** steward-protocol (original)

**Location B: `vibe_core/runtime/playbook_engine.py`**
- **Size:** 180 lines
- **Purpose:** Intent Router ("Conveyor Belt #2")
- **What it does:**
  - Routes `user_intent + context → task playbook`
  - Tier 1/2/3 matching (keywords, context, suggested)
  - Returns PlaybookRoute with confidence levels
  - Lean logic (no ML for MVP)
- **Used by:** boot_sequence.py
- **Origin:** vibe-agency (Phase 2 merge)

**Location C: `vibe_core/playbook/executor.py`**
- **Size:** 705 lines
- **Purpose:** Graph-based Workflow Orchestrator
- **What it does:**
  - WorkflowGraph (nodes + edges)
  - Topological sort, dependency validation
  - Execution plan generation
  - Dry-run mode for testing
  - "OPERATION SEMANTIC MOTOR"
- **Aliased as:** `PlaybookEngine` in `vibe_core/playbook/__init__.py`
- **Used by:** loader.py, runner.py, router_bridge.py
- **Origin:** vibe-agency (Phase 2 merge)

**Impact:**
```python
# This is now AMBIGUOUS:
from xxx import PlaybookEngine

# Which one?
# A) envoy/playbook_engine.py?
# B) vibe_core/runtime/playbook_engine.py?
# C) vibe_core/playbook/executor.py (aliased)?
```

**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Import collisions will cause runtime errors

---

### 2. "playbook" (Triple Directory Collision)

**Location A: `vibe_core/playbook/`**
- **Purpose:** Workflow orchestration system (from vibe-agency)
- **Contents:**
  - executor.py (GraphExecutor)
  - loader.py (workflow loading)
  - runner.py (execution runner)
  - tasks/ (task definitions)
  - workflows/ (workflow definitions)
  - _registry.yaml
- **Origin:** vibe-agency (Phase 2)

**Location B: `knowledge/playbooks/`**
- **Purpose:** Playbook YAML definitions (from steward-protocol)
- **Contents:**
  - content_generation.yaml
  - governance_vote.yaml
  - project_scaffold.yaml
  - feature_implement_safe.yaml
  - GAD-5500-SAFE-EVOLUTION-LOOP.md
  - README.md
- **Origin:** steward-protocol (original)

**Location C: `vibe_core/cartridges/archivist/playbooks/`**
- **Purpose:** Agent-specific playbooks
- **Contents:** TBD (not yet inspected)
- **Origin:** vibe-agency (Phase 2)

**Are these the same thing?**
- A) = **ENGINE** (how to execute)
- B) = **DATA** (what to execute)
- C) = **AGENT-SPECIFIC** (archivist's playbooks)

**Impact:** Naming confusion. Developers won't know where to put playbooks.

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Confusing but not breaking (different purposes)

---

### 3. runtime/ (Partial Collision)

**Already existed in steward-protocol:** NO (new directory from Phase 2)

**Merged from vibe-agency:**
```
vibe_core/runtime/
├── boot_sequence.py
├── oracle.py
├── playbook_engine.py  # ← Collision with envoy/playbook_engine
├── prompt_context.py
└── interface.py
```

**Conflicts with:**
- `steward/system_agents/envoy/playbook_engine.py` (different PlaybookEngine)

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Namespaced differently, but semantically confusing

---

### 4. store/ (Potential Collision)

**Merged:** `vibe_core/store/`
- ArtifactStore (mutable data storage)
- ManifestStore
- Shadow DB (SQLite fallback)

**Already exists:** `vibe_core/ledger.py`
- Immutable audit trail
- Event sourcing

**Are these the same?**
- store/ = Mutable data (artifacts, manifests)
- ledger.py = Immutable audit trail
- **Different purposes, OK to coexist**

**Severity:** 🟢 LOW - No collision (complementary)

---

### 5. agents/ vs agent_protocol.py (Partial Collision)

**Merged:** `vibe_core/agents/`
- SimpleLLMAgent (base class)
- SpecialistAgent
- SystemMaintenanceAgent

**Already exists:** `vibe_core/agent_protocol.py`
- VibeAgent (base interface)
- AgentManifest

**Are these the same?**
- agent_protocol.py = **INTERFACE** (what agents must implement)
- agents/ = **IMPLEMENTATIONS** (concrete agent classes)
- **Different layers, OK to coexist**

**Severity:** 🟢 LOW - No collision (different layers)

---

### 6. config/ (Unknown Status)

**Merged:** `vibe_core/config/`
- loader.py
- schemas/

**Already exists:** `config/` (root level)
- matrix.yaml
- soul.yaml

**Potential conflict:** Two config systems?

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Need to investigate

---

### 7. governance/ (Complementary)

**Merged:** `vibe_core/governance/`
- InvariantChecker (pre-flight code quality checks)

**Already exists:** `steward/constitutional_oath.py`
- Agent identity verification
- ECDSA signatures

**Are these the same?**
- InvariantChecker = Pre-flight checks (code quality, rules)
- Constitutional Oath = Agent identity & governance
- **Complementary, not conflicting**

**Severity:** 🟢 LOW - No collision

---

### 8. specialists/ (New)

**Merged:** `vibe_core/specialists/`
- PlanningSpecialist
- CodingSpecialist
- TestingSpecialist

**Conflicts with:** NONE (new concept)

**Relation to steward agents:**
- These are SYSTEM agents (like CIVIC, HERALD)
- Should they be in `steward/system_agents/`?
- Or stay in `vibe_core/specialists/`?

**Severity:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Architectural question

---

## 📊 COLLISION SUMMARY

| Component | Locations | Severity | Same Thing? | Action Needed |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **PlaybookEngine** | 3 files | 🔴 CRITICAL | NO - 3 different | UNIFY |
| **playbook directories** | 3 dirs | 🟡 MEDIUM | NO - engine vs data | CLARIFY |
| **runtime/** | 1 dir | 🟡 MEDIUM | N/A | OK (new) |
| **store/ vs ledger** | 2 files | 🟢 LOW | NO - complementary | OK |
| **agents/ vs protocol** | 2 files | 🟢 LOW | NO - interface vs impl | OK |
| **config/** | 2 dirs | 🟡 MEDIUM | UNKNOWN | INVESTIGATE |
| **governance/** | 2 files | 🟢 LOW | NO - complementary | OK |
| **specialists/** | 1 dir | 🟡 MEDIUM | N/A | DECIDE placement |

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why did this happen?

**Phase 2 instructions said:**
> "Copy code from vibe-agency → Merge with existing steward-protocol"
> "Keep BOTH when they serve different purposes"

**Problem:** We copied **without checking for NAME collisions**.

**Result:** We now have:
- 3 classes named `PlaybookEngine`
- Multiple `playbook` directories
- Semantic confusion

### What should have been done?

**BEFORE merging:**
1. Inventory all existing steward-protocol components
2. Inventory all vibe-agency components to merge
3. **Compare NAMES** (not just purposes)
4. Identify collisions
5. Create RENAMING strategy
6. THEN merge with new names

**We skipped steps 3-5.**

---

## 🔧 UNIFICATION STRATEGY

### Option A: Namespace Separation (CLEAN)

**Rename everything with clear namespaces:**

```python
# OLD (COLLISION):
from envoy.playbook_engine import PlaybookEngine  # GAD-5000
from vibe_core.runtime.playbook_engine import PlaybookEngine  # Router
from vibe_core.playbook import PlaybookEngine  # Graph Executor

# NEW (NO COLLISION):
from envoy.playbook_executor import DeterministicExecutor  # GAD-5000
from vibe_core.runtime.playbook_router import PlaybookRouter  # Router
from vibe_core.playbook import GraphExecutor  # Graph Executor
```

**Renames:**
1. `envoy/playbook_engine.py` → `envoy/playbook_executor.py`
   - Class: `PlaybookEngine` → `DeterministicExecutor`
2. `vibe_core/runtime/playbook_engine.py` → `vibe_core/runtime/playbook_router.py`
   - Class: `PlaybookEngine` → `PlaybookRouter`
3. `vibe_core/playbook/executor.py` → Keep as `GraphExecutor` (already correct)
   - Remove alias: `PlaybookEngine = GraphExecutor`

**Pros:**
- ✅ No collisions
- ✅ Clear purpose from name
- ✅ Easy to understand

**Cons:**
- ❌ Breaks existing imports (need to update ~20 files)
- ❌ Requires careful testing

---

### Option B: Consolidation (COMPLEX)

**Merge all 3 PlaybookEngines into ONE:**

```python
class UnifiedPlaybookEngine:
    """Unified playbook system"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.executor = DeterministicExecutor()  # GAD-5000 sequential
        self.router = IntentRouter()              # Intent matching
        self.graph = GraphExecutor()              # Graph orchestration

    def execute_playbook(self, playbook_yaml):
        """Execute GAD-5000 playbook"""
        return self.executor.run(playbook_yaml)

    def route_intent(self, user_input):
        """Route user intent to playbook"""
        return self.router.match(user_input)

    def execute_workflow(self, workflow_graph):
        """Execute graph-based workflow"""
        return self.graph.run(workflow_graph)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Single entry point
- ✅ No name collisions

**Cons:**
- ❌ VERY complex to implement
- ❌ Mixes concerns (routing + execution)
- ❌ Violates single responsibility principle
- ❌ HIGH risk of bugs

---

### Option C: Gradual Migration (SAFE but SLOW)

**Keep all 3 for now, add deprecation warnings:**

```python
# envoy/playbook_engine.py
import warnings

class PlaybookEngine:  # Old name
    def __init__(self):
        warnings.warn(
            "envoy.playbook_engine.PlaybookEngine is deprecated. "
            "Use envoy.deterministic_executor.DeterministicExecutor instead.",
            DeprecationWarning
        )
        # ... existing code ...

# New file: envoy/deterministic_executor.py
class DeterministicExecutor:
    # ... copied from PlaybookEngine ...
```

**Phase out over time:**
1. Phase 2.5: Add new names + deprecation warnings
2. Phase 3: Update all imports to use new names
3. Phase 4: Remove old names

**Pros:**
- ✅ Safest approach
- ✅ No breaking changes immediately
- ✅ Time to test

**Cons:**
- ❌ Slowest
- ❌ Technical debt persists temporarily

## 📋 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION

**Use Option A: Namespace Separation**

**Why:**
- Clean break, no half-measures
- Forces us to understand what each component does
- Prevents future confusion
- Aligns with "rock solid" goal

**Implementation Plan:**

### Step 1: Rename Files (30 minutes)
```bash
# Rename files
mv envoy/playbook_engine.py envoy/deterministic_executor.py
mv vibe_core/runtime/playbook_engine.py vibe_core/runtime/playbook_router.py

# Update class names inside files
# envoy/deterministic_executor.py: PlaybookEngine → DeterministicExecutor
# vibe_core/runtime/playbook_router.py: PlaybookEngine → PlaybookRouter
```

### Step 2: Update Imports (1 hour)
```python
# Files to update (~20):
- steward/system_agents/envoy/*.py
- provider/universal_provider.py
- vibe_core/runtime/boot_sequence.py
- tests/test_playbook_*.py
- scripts/testing/verify_gad5500_live.py
```

### Step 3: Test (1 hour)
```bash
pytest tests/test_playbook_*.py -v
bin/agent-city status
```

### Step 4: Document (30 minutes)
Update ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md with:
- DeterministicExecutor (GAD-5000 sequential execution)
- PlaybookRouter (intent matching)
- GraphExecutor (graph-based workflows)

**Total Time:** ~3 hours

## 📊 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### If we DON'T fix this:

**Immediate:**
- ❌ Import ambiguity (which PlaybookEngine?)
- ❌ Runtime errors (wrong class imported)
- ❌ Confusion for developers

**Long-term:**
- ❌ Impossible to reason about system
- ❌ Bug multiplication (changes affect wrong component)
- ❌ "Spaghetti" architecture
- ❌ Failure to deliver "rock solid" system

### If we DO fix this:

**Immediate:**
- ✅ Clear component boundaries
- ✅ No import collisions
- ✅ Easy to understand

**Long-term:**
- ✅ Maintainable codebase
- ✅ "Water tight" architecture
- ✅ Ready for QUANTUM NEURAL evolution
- ✅ Proves we're "doing it right, not just fast"

## 🚦 GO/NO-GO DECISION

**Phase 3 (Cleanup & Refactoring):** 🔴 **NO-GO**

**Reason:** Cannot proceed with semantic collisions unresolved.

**Required Before Phase 3:**
1. ✅ Resolve PlaybookEngine triple collision (Option A)
2. ✅ Clarify playbook directory purposes
3. ✅ Document unified architecture
4. ✅ Test all integrations

**Estimated Time:** 1 day

**Alternative:** Proceed to Phase 3 and "fix it later" → 🔴 **NOT RECOMMENDED**

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

**For User (Decision Maker):**
1. Review this report
2. Choose unification strategy (A, B, or C)
3. Approve before continuing

**For Haiku (Implementation):**
1. WAIT for approval
2. DO NOT proceed to Phase 3
3. Execute chosen unification strategy
4. Test and verify

**For Sonnet (Architect):**
1. Stand by for feedback
2. Refine plan based on user input
3. Create detailed implementation guide

---

## 💬 QUESTIONS FOR USER

1. **Do you agree this is critical?**
2. **Which strategy: A (namespace), B (consolidate), or C (gradual)?**
3. **Should we audit OTHER collisions too** (config/, specialists/, etc.)?
4. **Do you want a FULL system audit** before proceeding?
