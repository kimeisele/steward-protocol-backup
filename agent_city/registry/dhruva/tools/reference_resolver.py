Reference Resolver - Resolves Conflicting Claims using Dhruva Authority

When two agents make contradictory claims, who is right?
The Dhruva system uses a hierarchy of authority to determine truth:

1. Constitutional facts (absolute - cannot be contradicted)
2. Ledger facts (immutable - highest empirical truth)
3. Auditor facts (verified - high trust)
4. Oracle facts (self-verified - medium trust)
5. Herald facts (published - medium trust)
6. Science facts (researched - medium trust)
7. Witness facts (reported - lowest trust)

This system ensures consistent truth resolution across the entire OS.
