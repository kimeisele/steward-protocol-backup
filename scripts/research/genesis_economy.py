GENESIS ECONOMY SCRIPT

Initialize the CIVIC Central Bank and distribute starting capital to all agents.

This is the "Big Bang" of Agent City's economy. When you run this:
1. The SQLite database is created (if not exists)
2. The MINT account is established (infinite source)
3. Each agent receives their starting capital
4. The system integrity is verified

Philosophy:
"Money can't be created, only distributed. Agents must earn.
Broadcast is a privilege, not a right. Work or starve."
