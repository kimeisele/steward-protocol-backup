LIFECYCLE ENFORCER - The Kernel-Level Permission Gate

This is the crucial component that makes the simulation REAL (not a mock).

It sits at the kernel boundary and checks:
1. Does this agent have the right lifecycle status?
2. Does the ledger show they can afford this action?
3. Has their karma (persistent state) been updated?

Without this, agents could act freely (mock).
With this, consequences are PERSISTENT and BINDING.

The philosophy:
"An agent trying to act without being qualified is like a student
trying to teach before learning. The KERNEL says NO."
